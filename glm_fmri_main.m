% glm_fmri_main

% Main wrapper script for running a glm on fmri data.  This assumes files
% are organized according to the structure set u

% Before using this script, regressor time series should be generated and
% saved in subjDir/regs directory

% There are four main parts:

%      1) Define relevant subjects, scan runs, stims, etc. to model
%      2) Create regressor time series and a glm design matrix (glm_fmri_mat)
%      3) Fitting the glm model to data (glm_fmri_fit)
%      4) exploring and visualizing model fit statistics (glm_fmri_vis, not yet implemented)
