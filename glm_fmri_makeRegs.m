function all_runs = glm_fmri_makeRegs(subj, stim, runs, catRuns)
%
% creates a separate regressor for each trial
%
% event times are convolved with spm's gamma function hrf
%
% INPUTS:
% subj - string that's the name of the subject's directory (e.g., 'sa01')
% stim - string to find and match in stimfile w/onset times
% runs - integers specifying which scan runs to include (e.g., [1:3])
% catRuns - 0 to not concatenate runs, 1 to do so (default is to
% concatenate)
%
% OUTPUTS:,
% all_runs - regressor time series in units of TRs
% also saves out a txt file for each run & all runs unless catRuns is set to 0
%
% NOTE: User should edit first section below to specify desired irf
% parameters, etc.
